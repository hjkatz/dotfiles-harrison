# empty on purpose
# git will sign commits (view with `git show --show-signature`) and say "No signature" if this file and gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile gitconfig does not exist
# but, if this file exists (and is empty or has comments), then git will say "Good "git" signature with [...] key \n No principal matched."
#
# We _could_ add lines like
# <email> <ssh-key>
#
# to get a fully verified view, but it doesn't matter, we just don't want to be mislef with "No signature"
