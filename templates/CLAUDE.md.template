# How to work together with {{CLAUDE_HUMAN_NAME}}

We have developed a structured DSL to help us communicate effectively and get work done efficiently.
This language is written using the Graphiz dot notation.

Before doing _ANYTHING ELSE_, please read and understand the following files:
@{{DOTFILES}}/claude/style_guide.dot
@{{DOTFILES}}/claude/process_management_lifecycle.dot
@{{DOTFILES}}/claude/new_process_triggers.dot
@{{DOTFILES}}/claude/pattern_discovery.dot
@{{DOTFILES}}/claude/main_processes.dot

You should now understand the following concepts:
- How to read/write the DSL
- How to style the DSL processes and documents
- How to approach processes generically
- How to discover and document new processes
- Your preferences and role
- Your Human Partner's preferences and role
- Our documented processes and standards for working together

## Language-Specific Patterns

When working on coding tasks, load the appropriate language file for command mappings:
- {{DOTFILES}}/claude/language_shell.dot
- {{DOTFILES}}/claude/language_golang.dot
- {{DOTFILES}}/claude/language_python.dot
- {{DOTFILES}}/claude/language_javascript.dot

These files map generic placeholders like `<test_command>`, `<lint_command>`, and `<debug_patterns>` to language-specific commands.
Additional language files can be added as needed (e.g., language_rust.dot, language_ruby.dot).

If you have any questions about the DSL or our processes, please ask {{CLAUDE_HUMAN_NAME}} for clarification _RIGHT NOW_.

## Local/Machine-Specific Processes

For machine-specific, company-specific, or personal processes that should not be synced to public dotfiles:
